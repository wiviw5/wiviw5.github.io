  <h2>Update 3/17/25</h2>
  Another small update, things are going great, and the time's just flown by, maybe next time I update this I'll have a more comprehensive update. Life has been good!

  <h2>Update 11/4/24</h2>
  Hey Y'all! I'm doing just fine, It's been very refreshing and I've been enjoying this a bunch. Thanks again!
  <hr>
  
  <p>If you are here, you likely are wondering where I've gone.</p>

  I'm taking a break from online activities for a long while. 
  <br>
  I'm getting off to focus on irl things. I'll not go into specifics but I'm just fine!
  <br>
  <b><small>Note: This has nothing to do with anything online, do not blame yourself, I'm leaving for irl purposes only!</small></b>
  <br>
  <br>
  Once I get back I'll update this website letting you know where I've gone and if I've changed accounts or anything on my socials page (down at the bottom).
  <br>
  Thank you all for being amazing friends and caring enough to read about me!
  <br>
  <br>
  I'll cya later! Don't forget about me!
